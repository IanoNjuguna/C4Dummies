## Description

This directory contains my solutions to the tasks I tackled while using the book on C by Dan Gookin titled,[Beginning Programming with C for Dummies](https://africa1lib.vip/book/2214891/8964c6)

I found this book insightful in that the author assumes that you don't have prior experience with programming.

The IDE of choice is: ```CODE BLOCKS``` & ```VS Code```
