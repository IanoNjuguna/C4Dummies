# BegC4D

## Description

This repository contains my solutions to the tasks I tackled while using the book on C by Dan Gookin titled,[Beginning Programming with C for Dummies](http://www.c-for-dummies.com/begc4d/exercises)

I found this book insightful in that the author assumes that you don't have prior experience with programming.

The IDE of choice is: ```CODE BLOCKS``` / ```VS Code``` / ```NeoVim``` / ```Vim```
